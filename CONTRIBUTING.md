# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Project Status

This project is currently undergoing major architectural changes and refactoring.
Because of this, I’m not accepting pull requests at the moment.

The internal structure, APIs, and core concepts are evolving, and reviewing or merging PRs right now would likely create unnecessary rework for everyone involved.

Once the refactor stabilizes, I’ll update this file accordingly.

## Before Opening a Pull Request

In general, please open an issue first before submitting a pull request.

I prefer to:
- Discuss the feature or change beforehand
- Align on scope and design decisions
- Ensure the change fits the long-term vision of the project

Since I like to implement many features myself (especially core ones), there’s a chance a pull request might not align with what I have planned. Opening an issue first helps avoid wasted effort on your side.

## Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are always welcome. Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Screenshots or logs (if applicable)
- Environment details (Browser, OS, etc.)

## Questions

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate to contribute, just write in the Project channel in the Discord server or open an issue and ask. I'm happy to discuss ideas.


Thanks again for your interest and understanding!
